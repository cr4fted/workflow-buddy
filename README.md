# ⚡ WorkFlow Buddy  
**Your not-so-judgy, super chill time-tracking buddy for Windows**  

Let’s be real — you’re deep in code, coffee’s gone cold, and suddenly it’s 3 PM. Did you even take a lunch break? WorkFlow Buddy keeps track of your hours, your breaks, and your “oops-I-lost-track-of-time” in break moment — all in a clean, distraction-free interface.
